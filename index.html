                                                  <p>How on earth does this happen? “It helps to understand that our

                                                       designed to store excess energy in fat cells,”
                                                       says endocrinologist Bartolome Burguera, MD, PhD.</p>
                                                  <p>If you’re carrying extra pounds, it means you’re taking in more
                                                       energy
                                                       (calories are units of energy) than you’re using.</p>
                                                  <p>“The extra energy is stored in adipose tissue all around your body
                                                       in the

                                                       says Dr. Burguera. Smaller amounts of energy are stored in your

                                                  <p>How does your body use energy? In more ways than you’d think:</p>
                                                  <p>When you’re resting. Your heart needs energy to pump, your lungs to

                                                       and your brain to think. (That’s your basal metabolism.)</p>
                                                  <p>When you’re active. Your muscles need energy whether you’re only

                                                  <p>When you’re eating. Your digestive system needs energy to break

                                                       Because of
                                                       this deficit, your body turns to fat reserves for energy.</p>

                                                  <p>Your muscles first burn through stored glycogen for energy. “After

                                                  <p>Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of cardio two to three times

                                                       Increasing muscle mass may help you burn more calories and raise

                                                       loss.
                                                       But aerobic exercise alone may hold the power to help you lose
                                                       weight and
                                                       keep it off.

                                                  <p>In one study, researchers asked overweight participants to keep
                                                       their diets

                                                       but to engage in exercise sessions that would burn either 400 to
                                                       600
                                                       calories, 5 times a week, for 10 months.

                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>The results showed significant weight loss, between 4.3 and 5.7
                                                       percent of
                                                       their starting weights,
                                                       for both men and women. Most participants walked or jogged on
                                                       treadmills
                                                       for the majority of their exercise sessions.
                                                       If you don’t have access to a treadmill, try taking a few brisk
                                                       walks or
                                                       jogs a day, such as during your lunch break or before dinner.

                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>Depending on your weight and speed, you may need to walk or jog up
                                                       to 4 miles
                                                       to burn 400 to 600 calories.
                                                       Cutting calories in addition to aerobic exercise can reduce the
                                                       amount of
                                                       exercise needed to lose the same amount of weight.

                                                  <p>one group exercised on a treadmill for 30 minutes

                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>The results showed that regular and moderate aerobic exercise
                                                       increases
                                                       certain antibodies in the blood called immunoglobulins.
                                                       That ultimately strengthens the immune system. The sedentary
                                                       group of women
                                                       saw no improvement in immune system function and their cortisol
                                                       levels were
                                                       much higher than those in the active groups.

                                                  <p>Moving your body may also improve your mood. In one study on

                                                       participants walked on a treadmill doing intervals for 30 minutes
                                                       a session. After 10 days,
                                                       they were asked to report any changes in their mood.

                                                  <p>All participants reported a significant reduction in their symptoms
                                                       of depression.
                                                       These results suggest that engaging in exercise, even for a short
                                                       period of time, may have a big impact on mood.

                                                  <p>You don’t need to wait almost two weeks to see improvement.
                                                       The study results revealed that even a single exercise session
                                                       may be enough to give you a boost.

                                                       lead to broken bones,
                                                       and potentially create lifelong injuries or disabilities.
                                                       Exercise may help reduce your risk for falls.
                                                       And if you’re worried you’re too old to start exercising, don’t

                                                       can reduce the risk of falling by promoting better balance and
                                                       agility. The women worked out for an hour,
                                                       3 times a week, for a total of 12 weeks. The dance sessions
                                                       included plenty of squatting motions, leg balance,
                                                       and other basic gross motor tasks.

                                                       They also had better grip strength and reach, all important
                                                       physical strengths that can protect the body from falls.

                                                       The instructor can tell you if you’re doing moves correctly and
                                                       they can also give you modifications,
                                                       if needed, to reduce your risk for injury.

                                                       aerobic exercise five or more days each week.
                                                       That can be broken up, though. For example, you can take three,
                                                       10-minute walks throughout the day.

                                                  <p>You should also add in two or more anaerobic strengthening sessions
